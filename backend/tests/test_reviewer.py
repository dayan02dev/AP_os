"""Tests for the reviewer endpoints (Phase 1.5).

Mirrors the FakeSupabase pattern used in test_leadership_writes.py:
  - _FakeAdminClient + _FakeQuery for table mocking
  - app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user] for auth
  - monkeypatch on get_admin_client + write_audit

Coverage matrix (this file builds up across Tasks 1-7):
  * /reviewer/assignments — inbox shape, filtering rules
  * /reviewer/applications/{track}/{id} — privacy boundary
  * /reviewer/reviews — submit, draft, validation, auto-transition
  * /reviewer/reviews/{id} — 423 lock, edit-within-window
  * /reviewer/assignments/{id}/decline — happy path + audit
  * /reviewer/reviews — completed list filter
  * /reviewer/reviews/mine — probe endpoint
